  <p>Imagine that your friend wants to bake a huge apple pie and he needs a lot of apples. He goes to the market to find the right stall and ask for apples. Your friend needs at least 202 apples. Help your friend!</p> 
  <p>Create a function called <code class="java">check()</code> that takes a string. First, check whether the string is a number. If it is not, print the message <code class="java">"It is not a number!"</code> If it is, change the type of your input value to <code class="java">int</code> and check whether the number is more than <code class="java">202</code> or equal to <code class="java">202</code>. If so, print the number. Otherwise, print another message <code class="java">"There are less than 202 apples! You cheated me!"</code></p> 
  <p>You do not need to take any input or call the function yourself.</p>
