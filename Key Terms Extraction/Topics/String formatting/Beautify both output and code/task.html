<h2>Beautify both output and code</h2>

  <p>The output should be user-friendly, but the code part is also important. Well-structured and readable code is very important for being a good programmer. Now it's up to you to decide, which formatting method to choose.</p> 
  <p>Imagine you need to compose a dynamic URL for every certain user with user-specific details. Suppose, you want to send different URLs for every user, depending on their name and profession. The base would be something like</p> 
  <p>"http://example.com/*<strong>nickname</strong>*/desirable/*<strong>profession</strong>*/profile", where nickname and profession are prompts from a user and are dynamic.</p> 
  <p>Read the nickname and profession of the user from the input and print a user-specific URL. Don't bother about any rules of composing the URLs and just use raw input to accomplish the task.</p>
