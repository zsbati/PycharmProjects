<h2>Mystery dictionary</h2>

 <body>
  <p>Sometimes we have to work with data we've never seen before. There is a <strong>dictionary</strong> <code class="java">random_dict</code> that contains <strong>strings</strong> as keys. You don't know what exactly is in the dictionary.</p> 
  <p>Your task is to work with the input. The input word is stored in the variable <code class="java">word</code>. If the input word is a key in the <code class="java">random_dict</code>, print its dictionary value. Otherwise, print "<strong>Not in the dictionary</strong>". For example, the word <strong>banana</strong> is a key in <code class="java">random_dict</code>, so we can print its value. As for the word <strong>snow</strong>, it turns out it's not a key, so we have to print the corresponding message.</p> 
  <p>Note that the dictionary has already been defined. Use one of the techniques described in the topic.</p>
