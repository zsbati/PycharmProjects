  <p>A couple of friends that you know have recently become parents. Moreover, they have bought a puppy! However, they are having a hard time coming up with a name for it. They have decided that the name should start with any letter from B to N and the second character has to be a vowel.</p> 
  <p>Write a program that checks whether a name suits these two criteria and prints <em>"</em>Suitable!" if a match is found. </p>
